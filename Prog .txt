TYPE SYSTEMS

Type systems are basically made of different types and these types are referred to as data types some examples of pre-defined data types are strings, integers and bools. Most programming languages are distinguished by several characteristics which may include some kind of type system which sets the categories of objects to be worked with and how they will be handled.

Taking python as an example, we'll be considering two of the pre-defined data types, strings and int. For strings a set of rules are applied, i.e they can be concatenated, split, iterable etc. On the other hand, integers can be added and subtracted, trying to add an int and a string would throw a type error because it's against the rule set.

The example above is a python interactive shell, two variables A and B were assigned different data, with different data types 1 as an integer and Richie as a string.

Passing the two variables through the type function, it pops a <type 'int'> for A and a <type 'str'> for B each having different sets of rules following thier operations, o 
Type systems can be further classified into two major groups namely;
* Dynamic Type systems
* Static Type systems

#### Dynamic Type systems
Python can be characterized as one having a dynamic type system
